# Ok, just another todo app... overkil.

This is the back end to this [front-end](https://github.com/pdoms/doit_web).

# Goals

- [x] github actions
- [x] kinda finish it
- [-] i3block that notiies about overdue tasks (strong maybe)
 
# Usage
If you really wanna use it, feel free to do so.

On linux: 

You will need to have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) insalled.
And also [postrgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
1. Clone [this](https://github.com/pdoms/serve) repo 
2. move the serve executable into the root of the "doit" app.
3. make ``run.sh`` executable.
4. execute ``run.sh``

Configure the ports and hosts in the ``.env`` file.

I might add windows support for the ``run.sh`` script.
